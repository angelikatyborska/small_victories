# Small Victories Angular Front-end Client
An Angular front-end client for a Ruby on Rails app for sharing your small victories with the World.

The main purpose of this project was to test my Rails API against a live app. This is my first attempt at Angular code ever, so please disregard it's low quality. 

## Demo
[Here](https://small-victories-front.herokuapp.com).

Sign in as `userX@example.com` with password `password`, where X is an integer between 0 and 29.

## Dependencies
- Node 5.5.0

### Setup
If you want to run this app on your machine:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run dev`
